# Prediction_models
I have created two different prediction models : 1. Cars price prediction model and 2. Propulsion plant evaluation model. In the first one I have compared 3 regression models for predicting car prices based on certain features and in the end final model was selected. In the second project, two decay state coefficients were predicted using ML and DL models .
